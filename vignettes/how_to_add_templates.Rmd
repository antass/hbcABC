How to add new templates to HBC repository in 30 lines.

First you need to clone [hbcABC](https://github.com/hbc/hbcABC) repo to your computer.

After that, the easiest way to create templates is to follow this structure.

Inside the folder `inst/rmarkdown/templates` create a folder with the name of the RMD template you want to add, for instance: `hello_word_rmd`.

Then, create a YAML file named `template.yaml` with the following information:

```
name: Name of the template
description: >
  Description that will be shown in Rstudio.
create_dir: false
```
 
Create another folder named: `skeleton` and inside this a RMD file named `skeleton.Rmd` containing the rmarkdown you want to add.

At the end you'll should have this folders tree under `inst/rmarkdown`:

```
templates
-- hello_world_rmd
---- template.yaml
---- skeleton
------- skeleton.Rmd
```

To test it, install the package and go to the `File` -> `New File` -> `R Markdown` and click on templates. Your new template should be there.
